# LED-Decorative-pattern-Using-Arduino

This is a fun DIY project did using Arduino. 

This Arduino sketch controls 7 digital output pins (D1 to D7) in various patterns to create lighting effects using LEDs or other digital output devices.

## Features

- Blinking patterns
- Sequential LED animations
- Custom delay patterns


## Requirements

- Arduino UNO (or compatible)
- 7 Outputs (connected to digital pins 1 to 7)
- 220-ohm resistors (one per LED)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
